# dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles used to customize my development environment. It includes my configuration for bash and git,
adding aliases and enabling custom coloring and custom prompts. I've also added scripts for installing homebrew and if on macOS, adds homebrew/cask and installs several desktop apps.

*This repository is not designed for general purpose use but more tailored specifically to my own preferrences.*
